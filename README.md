This app is a search engine: It gets a keyword and returns all the names of the students in the course 
that contains this keyword with a link to their JSON file.
 
Before running the app, open a directory, and from this directory 
clone the remote repository containing the JSON files, by typing in the command line: 

git clone [https://github.com/Code-Maven/wis-advanced-python-2021-2022.git](https://github.com/Code-Maven/wis-advanced-python-2021-2022.git) .
 
Download the app.py and the config.txt to the same directory and run the app from that directory. 
The JSON files are in the local repository called 'students'. 
Copy the path of the 'students' directory to the config file.
